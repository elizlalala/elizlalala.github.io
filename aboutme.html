    <h3>A Very Brief Intro To Me</h3>
    <p>Admittedly, the content that has been on this site for quite some time has very little to do with my factual life.  It's an excerpt from Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas novel.  The facts are a bit more like this:<br>
    I was born and raised in Louisiana, but since then I have lived in Los Angeles, Chicago, and now, San Francisco.  I studied math in college and embarked on a life as a data analyst.  As fun as data analytics is, I'm craving more knowledge and a deeper skillset to design and use databases, data warehousing, machine learning algorithms, etc.  So I've embarked on this affair with  computer programming to see if I might find substance beyond the craving.<br>
    Beyond why I chose to attend DevBootcamp, I'm a fiction novel junky - Tom Robbins is my current favorite.  I recently decided to focus on New Journalism, namely Tom Wolfe and Hunter S. Thompson.  Hence the excerpt.  I also love cooking and driving... fast.
