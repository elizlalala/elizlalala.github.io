<!-- 
Q: How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
A: It was challenging.  Wireframing is about a design and layout and there is so much personal vision and preference that comes into play.  So I can see where designing as a team would be very challenging.  Functionally, wireframing while pairing was really awkward too.  I was driving while in blasamiq, and trying to listen and interpret what he wanted drawn but I had this constant concern that he would've prefered things just a millimeter or so different.

Q: Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
A: Definitely.  Jumping into HTML is much easier when you are not worried about conceiving the design of the website while you are coding.  The wireframe design acts as a very essential blueprint.

Q: What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
A: I chose Balsamiq because it was recommended and free to download.  I'm fine with it for the purposes of this course.

Q: What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? 
A: We learned about <nav>, <header> and <footer>-->

		<h2>PHASE: 0<br>WEEK: 3<br>Relative Thoughts on Absolute Positioning</h2>
	<p>The prompt of this blog post was to do additional research on a handful of topics.  As it turns out, I had struggled so much with positioning in my website that I had already done a ton of extra reading on the various position values and their meaning.  I'm going to make some simple analogies to help illustrate the spectrum of control that CSS gives to you through these commands.</p>
	<p><span>Posistion: Static</span>
		<br>
		Static positioning is similar to the feather blowing in the wind at the beginning and end of Forrest Gump.
