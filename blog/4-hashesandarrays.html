<!-- 
Q: How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
A: It was challenging.  Wireframing is about a design and layout and there is so much personal vision and preference that comes into play.  So I can see where designing as a team would be very challenging.  Functionally, wireframing while pairing was really awkward too.  I was driving while in blasamiq, and trying to listen and interpret what he wanted drawn but I had this constant concern that he would've prefered things just a millimeter or so different.

Q: Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
A: Definitely.  Jumping into HTML is much easier when you are not worried about conceiving the design of the website while you are coding.  The wireframe design acts as a very essential blueprint.

Q: What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
A: I chose Balsamiq because it was recommended and free to download.  I'm fine with it for the purposes of this course.

Q: What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? 
A: We learned about <nav>, <header> and <footer>-->

		<h3>This Week's Banter</h3>
		<h2>PHASE: 0<br>WEEK: 4<br>Hashes and Arrays</h2>
	<p>The prompt of this blog post was to do additional research on a hases and arrays.  While I think there are a number of interesting distinctions to make between these two classes of objects, I'm prioritizing some time spent practicing coding with them more in the bonus challenges.  I will return to add to this blog more later this week when I have some more time.  ;)</p>
