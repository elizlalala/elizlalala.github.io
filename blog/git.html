        What are the benefits of version control?<br>
       <br> Version helps developers isolate errors or bugs within certain sets of changes.  It gives you confidence to iterate on code that works, but could be more efficient or more feature rich.  When you have a complete record of your code previously, you don’t have to be scared that you won’t be able to get back to it.<br>
       Imagine having 5 teams of developers working on advancing 5 different feature sets of a single live product or site.  If you were all saving on top of the original version, bugs could be introduced and you would have to track down which team introduced it and take steps back to get to the previously working version.<br>

          How does git help you keep track of changes?<br>
           <br>Git enables you to create a time-stamped library of your a project, product, website, etc at all different stages of development.<br>

          Why use GitHub to store your code?<br>
          <br>In addition to being a powerful collaboration tool and debugging asset as mentioned in my first paragraph, GitHub also acts as a massive back up for you and your team.
